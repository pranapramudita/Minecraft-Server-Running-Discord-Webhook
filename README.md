This thing is usefull to tell user that : 
1. Server is running 
2. Public IP Address with port (because public IP address can changes anytime)
3. Server is offline

### How to use :
1. open `.py` file and edit the webhook url to your webhook url
2. convert `.py` to `.exe` file, you can use (auto-py-to-exe)[https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/] for example
3. put the `.exe` file to same folder as `server.jar` and `server.bat` folder
4. run the `.exe`
